# TVB_Thesis

This repository contains the simulation notebooks and analysis scripts used for the master’s thesis on:

“How does anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) modulate functional connectivity within the brain of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients?”

# Contents

- TVB simulations of:
  - Healthy brain
  - Mild and severe TBI
  - Mild and severe TBI with tDCS
- Both single-subject and group-level implementations
- Functional connectivity, alpha power and graph theory analyses
- Final figures used in the thesis
